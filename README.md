# Learning Python
These are my notes from the [MIT course](https://youtu.be/nykOeWgQcHM) on Computer Science and Python. I'm leaving this repo public beacuse I believe this is a fine way to get to know someone. 

# What are you going to find?
My attemp on learning markdown, some ideas and concepts that I want to access whenever I need, and some of my random thoughts on the different topics.
